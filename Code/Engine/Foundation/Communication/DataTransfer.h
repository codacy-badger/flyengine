/// \brief A 'data transfer' is a blob of data that an application can send to connected tools such as plInspector upon request.
///
/// Data transfers can be used to allow an application to send large amounts of data to tools such as plInspector, which can then
/// display or process them somehow. An example usage is to send a screenshot or the different textures of the G-Buffer for analysis.
/// Or an application could send the current game state as one large text or binary document.
/// The data transfer can contain any kind of data, however depending on its type, the connected tools may be able to display the data
/// directly, or not.
/// The plDataTransfer object represents one logical group of data that will be sent all together. Each piece of data is represented
/// by an plDataTransferObject. E.g. each texture of a G-Buffer (diffuse, normals, depth) should be sent via one instance of plDataTransferObject.
/// Those instances of plDataTransferObject are just created on demand and destroyed directly after, they do not need to be kept around.
///
/// The plDataTransfer instance, however, needs to be created once and then kept around as long as the data transfer should be possible.
/// It is additionally necessary to enable the data transfer by calling EnableDataTransfer() once, which also specifies under which name
/// the transfer appears in the connected tools.
///
/// At runtime the application needs to check every plDataTransfer object regularly whether IsTransferRequested() returns true. If so,
/// the application should prepare all data by putting it into instances of plDataTransferObject and then transferring them through the
/// plDataTransfer object via plDataTransfer::Transfer().
///
/// The tools can request a data transfer at any time, however they will not block for the result. Thus whether an application 'answers'
/// or not, is not a problem, the application may just ignore the request. Similarly, the application may also 'push' out a data transfer,
/// even when no data was requested. However, this can overload the network bandwidth or the computer that runs plInspector, if not done
/// carefully.
